            The name Stromsy is derived from Straumsey,  the name of a mysterious island explored by Lief Eriksson. It is briefly described in the <a href="http://sagadb.org/eiriks_saga_rauda.en">Saga of Erik the Red</a>. Various locations have been proposed for Straumsey ranging from Baffin Island, Martha's Vineyard or even Manhattan.
